show(Math) is a newsletter + website I created for my 2020 Yale Summer Session class "Intro Interactive Design: WWW." The class was focused on introductory web development, going over the basics (HTML/CSS/JS) while also teaching us about the birth and rise of the internet and the modern web. The capstone project for the class was to design a newsletter: we were required to send out 6 issues via email and keep an archive of every newsletter on a website. 

 For my newsletter, I decided to combine my love of math and my love of CS by making a newsletter that explains some mathematical concept and provides code for an interative visualization that shows off the concept (hence show(Math)). Some visualizations were made with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), others were created with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). This was my first time using both of these libraries, so it was really fun to learn them and actually make something graphical. The website was built from scratch using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and deployed on netlify, which was a really good experience. I got a real handle of the fundamentals and I feel alot more comfortable learning the big-name JS frameworks.
 
This repo contains all the code I wrote for the newsletters. As for the HTML/CSS/JS used for the website, you can just use dev tools to see that. I am not sure whether I will send out more newsletters, however if I come across an interesting mathematical concept that I want to visualize I will be sure to put it on the website. Thank you for reading this all, and let me know if you have any ideas for some cool visualizations!
